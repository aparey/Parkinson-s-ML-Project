Parkinson's Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict Parkinson's disease based on various diagnostic measurements.
Overview
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder with no definitive diagnostic method. This project aims to use machine learning algorithms to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease in patients.
Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Feature selection using correlation analysis and chi-square test
Handling class imbalance with RandomOverSampler
Model training and evaluation using multiple classifiers:
Logistic Regression
XGBoost
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Dependencies
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
imbalanced-learn
Usage
Load the dataset (parkinson_disease.csv)
Preprocess the data
Perform feature selection
Handle class imbalance
Train and evaluate models
Visualize results
Results
The best-performing model achieves an accuracy of 75-80% in predicting Parkinson's disease.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in assisting with the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, showcasing how these techniques can be applied to real-world medical problems1
